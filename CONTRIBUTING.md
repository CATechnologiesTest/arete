# Contributing to Arete

Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing. 

Below you will find some basic steps required to be able to contribute to the project. If you have any questions about this process or any other aspect of contributing to a Yipee open source project, please open an [issue](https://github.com/yipeeio/arete/issues) and we'll get your questions answered as quickly as we can.

Pull Requests are always welcome, however they will only be accepted if they provide a reasonable test coverage.

## Workflow

Arete follows a standard GitHub pull request workflow. If you're unfamiliar with this workflow, read the very helpful [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) guide from GitHub.

## Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the README.md for build instructions

## Contribution Licensing

Since `Arete` is distributed under the terms of the [Apache Version 2 license](LICENSE), contributions that you make are licensed under the same terms. In order for us to be able to accept your contributions, we will need explicit confirmation from you that you are able and willing to provide them under these terms, and the mechanism we use to do this is called a Developer's Certificate of Origin [DCO](DCO.md).  This is very similar to the process used by the Linux(R) kernel, Samba, and many other major open source projects.

To participate under these terms, all that you must do is include a line like the following as the last line of the commit message for *each commit* in your contribution:

    `Signed-Off-By: John Q. Developer <johnq@developer.example.org>`

    The simplest way to accomplish this is to add `-s` or `--signoff` to your `git commit` command.

    You must use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms, and no anonymous contributions).

## Reporting bugs and creating issues

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. However, a good bug report has some very specific qualities, so please read over our short document on [reporting bugs](reporting_bugs.md) before submitting a bug report. This document might contain links to known issues, another good reason to take a look there before reporting a bug.

Thanks for contributing!
